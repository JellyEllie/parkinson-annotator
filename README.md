# Parkinson's Annotator

### Description:  
The Parkinson's Annotator project is a web-based application designed to help researchers and clinicians **upload, 
explore, and query** patient genomic data.  
This tool allows users to upload VCF and CSV files containing patient variant
data and provides an **interactive interface** for searching by patient name, variant notation, gene symbol or ClinVar 
pathogenicity classification.  
The results include relevant annotations and ClinVar information, to assist analysis of large scale patient genomic data.


### ✨ Features
- Upload patient data in VCF and CSV formats.
- Store and manage variant data in a local SQLite database
- Provides a lightweight Flask-based web application
- Dockerised deployment for reproducible, platform-independent execution
- Search variants by:
   - HGVS transcript notation
   - VCF-style genomic notation
   - Gene symbol
   - ClinVar pathogenicity classification
   - Patient name
- Retrieves external data from:
   - ClinVar
   - Variant Validator

## Project dependencies

Before using Parkinson's Annotator, ensure you have:

- Python 3.13+
- Pip
- Git

Runtime dependencies are managed via `pip` and defined in `pyproject.toml`, and installed according to the relevant instructions in the [source](docs/INSTALLATION.md) or [Docker](docs/DOCKER.md) installation manuals.

## Tools utilised
- **Flask:**  
Flask is a lightweight Python web framework used to build the interactive web interface of the Parkinson's Annotator. It handles routing, data uploads, and rendering HTML templates. The documentation can be found [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/).

- **SQLite:**  
SQLite is a lightweight, file-based relational database used to store patient and variant data. It allows for simple and faster querying and data storage without the need for a separate database server. The documentation can be found [here](https://sqlite.org/docs.html).

- **Clinvar API:**  
The ClinVar API provides access to public variant data and pathogenicity annotations. The application queries this API to fetch up-to-date information about genomic variants. Documentation can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/maintenance_use/#api).

- **Variant Validator API:**  
Variant Validator is an API used to validate and standardise genomic variant notation (HGVS, VCF formats). It ensures accurate input for searching and annotation. The documentation can be found [here](https://rest.variantvalidator.org).

- **Docker:**  
Docker is used to containerise the application, ensuring consistent deployment and development environments. It allows the app to run without manual setup of Python packages or system dependencies. The documentation can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com).


## 📚 Installation and usage instructions

This project is designed to run in a **Conda environment** on **Linux Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)** 
and is also **containerised using Docker** for easier deployment.

### 1. Installing the application:  

**Option 1: Local installation (source)**

Instructions for installing and running the application from source on your local machine are provided in the [installation manual](docs/INSTALLATION.md). This step-by-step guide walks through setting up the required environment configurations and dependencies for local development and execution.

**Option 2: Docker installation (recommended)**

Instructions for building and running the application using Docker are provided separately in the [Docker manual](docs/DOCKER.md). This guide covers containerised installation and execution, for a reproducible runtime environment without manual dependency setup. 

### 2. Running the application: 

Instructions on starting the application are provided in the [installation manual](docs/INSTALLATION.md) and [Docker manual](docs/DOCKER.md). 
Detailed intructions on how to run and use the application are provided in the [user manual](docs/USER_MANUAL.md).


## 🧬 Data

The Parkinson's Annotator processes patient-specific genomic variant data.
Supported formats: VCF, CSV  
Input assumption: Each file represents a single patient (e.g., `patient1.vcf`, `patient2.csv`). 

- **Example file structure:**  
  Each VCF or CSV file contains variant information with columns:

| #CHROM |   POS    | ID | REF | ALT |
|:------:|:--------:|:--:|:---:|:---:|
|   17   | 45983420 | .  |  G  |  T  |


## 🔨 Development and testing

This project includes supporting documentation for developers who wish to understand or modify the codebase. Full technical details including development environment setup, logging, testing, and CI/CD are provided in the [technical manual](docs/TECHNICAL_MANUAL.md).
- **Coding standards and best practices** The project follows standard PEP-8 standards and Flask best practices; using logging for traceability, and automated testing using `pytest`.
- **CI/CD** Continuous integration is implemented using Jenkins, with the pipeline defined in the Jenkinsfile
