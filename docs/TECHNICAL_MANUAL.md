## Project Overview

Parkinson’s Annotator is a Python-based application designed to assist Clinical Scientists in annotating genetic variants associated with Parkinson’s disease. The project provides a web interface for uploading, processing, and querying genetic variant data, integrating external resources such as VariantValidator and ClinVar. It uses Flask for the web backend, SQLAlchemy for database management, and various bioinformatics tools for data extraction and validation.
